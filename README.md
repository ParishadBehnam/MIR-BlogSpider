# MIR-BlogSpider
This is our third project for Modern Information Retrieval course in bachelor studies. This system crawls (using Scrapy) and processes blog.ir web pages, indexes them (using ElasticSearch), and calculates the PageRank value so that we can search through websites based on title, text, etc.
